ðŸš© How to set this up
If you don't already have Nodejs, install that. 
GitHub desktop might be helpful too. 

Then clone this repository, and set its origin or remote repository to this GitHub repository. 


ðŸš© How to use the server
Make sure to install all of the packages by doing 'npm i' which refers to the package.json file to download packages according to their versions. 

Start by using 'npx ts-node ./src/server.ts'. 
To see new changes, you'll have to terminate the application and re-run the command.

Make sure to install all of the packages by doing 'npm i' which refers to the package.json file to download packages according to their versions.

ðŸš© How to add changes
From what I understand, if you want to add some changes to the main branch, 
1) try creating a local branch on your computer.
2) make changes to the local branch on your computer.
3) when the branch is ready, go to the main branch and pull all of the changes to main.
4) then go to the development branch and merge with main. 
5) then go to the main branch and merge with the development branch
6) then push the main branch to the github repository. 

I think that you can use GitHub desktop too to make this easier...
